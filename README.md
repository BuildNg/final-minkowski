# Title

My final project for a philosophy/time travel class, a site demonstrating the Minkowski graph calculator. It primarily shows how fast/slow time would move if one travels at a significant percentage of the speed of light, $$3 \times 10^8$$. Used by the professor to aid students' understanding the following semesters.
